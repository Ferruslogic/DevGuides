# LiveCodeDevGuides
This extension is based on the code that "@Bernd Niggemann" wrote. It creates a system of guides to help LiveCode developers to accommodate the elements of the UI.

If you find something cool and interesting, thank "@Bernd Niggemann". If you find an error, it is our fault :(, but if you report it we can improve this extension.
